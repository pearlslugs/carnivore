conclusion_header: "[ADD A GOOD CONCLUSION/RECAP TITLE]"
conclusion_content: Here we write a conclusion. Never just end the page randomly.
  Ideally end       with a call to action. Tell your traffic what they need to do
  next. Let       there be continuation to their browsing session. Be sure you do
  this in       the form of a closing statement. Recap what you do why you are a good       choice
  and direct them to the next part of the process… the how it works       page perhaps?
  Remember this is strategic. We don’t do random, and       everything you do needs
  to have a solid reason or motive behind it!
