conclusion_header: ADD A GOOD CONCLUSION/RECAP TITLE
conclusion_content:
  Here we write a conclusion. Never just end the page randomly.
  Ideally end with a call to action. Tell your traffic what they need to do next.
  Let there be continuation to their browsing session. Be sure you do this in the
  form of a closing statement. Recap what you do why you are a good choice and direct
  them to the next part of the process… the how it works page perhaps? Remember this
  is strategic. We don’t do random, and everything you do needs to have a solid reason
  or motive behind it!
